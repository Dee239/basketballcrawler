basketball-crawler
==================

This is a python module to scrape basketball-reference.com and convert various stats into usable data structures for analysis.


Requirements
------------

Beautiful Soup (version 4 or above)

Pandas (0.11 or above)

Usage
-----

Still developing the API.  Right now you can get a list of all player overview urls, generate a list of game log urls for a given player, and convert that list into pandas dataframe.

I'll be putting up a IPython notebook here, too.
